*GOAL*

Add this in your config/environment.rb in Rails, or just use the
Middleware, in any Rack-compatible app. This will be implemented
using Thin + EventMachine, so you're likely going to need those as well.

config.middleware.use("Palmade::SocketIoRack::Middleware",
                      { :resources => {
                                        '/firehose/socket.io' => "Tweetitow::FirehoseSocket",
                                        '/echo' => "Palmade::SocketIoRack::EchoResource" } })
